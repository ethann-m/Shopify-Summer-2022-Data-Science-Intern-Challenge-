# Question-1

a.
For this calculation, the AOV is being calculated, which leads to $3145.13. This is not a good metric to record, as there are some orders which contain a large number of shoes, which leads to the AOV being greater. A better way to evaluate the data is to calculate the average item value

b.
this data set, I will report the average item value (AIV), which is the cost of each order divided by the number of items in the order.

c.
The AIV comes out to $357.92
